	<h3>Coding Projects</h3>
	
	<p>Below are some of the projects I really enjoyed making </p>
	
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Dratp/DiceRolling">Dice Rolling</a></li>
			<p>Dice Rolling was one of my earlier projects for class before I knew how to do Object oriented program, I was really proud of myself becuase I had the dice display next to each other.</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Dratp/GameofLife">Game of Life</a></li>
			<p>Game of Life was a fun challenging program that really helped me to conceptulize a problem and represent it in code</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Dratp/GuessACard">Guess a Card</a></li>
			<p>Guess a Card was made a time when we were just learning how to do obect oriented program I wanted to challenge myself further and this little game was a grea way to do it.</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Dratp/HeroCards">Hero Cards</a></li>
			<p>Hero Cards is my current work in progress.  This is the most complex thing I have coded thus far.  I started this project on my own to fix a gap in my life which is playing a RPG with friends... Yeah I  miss world of warcraft</p>
			<p>The premise behind hero cards is that you have a battle doll that you place into the arena and then give it moves by playing cards from your deck.</p>
